## üìä Dataset Description

The analysis utilizes two primary data sources:

1.  **`USvideos.csv`**: This dataset contains statistics for trending YouTube videos in the US, with **40,949 entries** and **16 columns** initially. Key columns can be grouped as follows:
    - **Video Identification & Metadata**: `video_id`, `title`, `channel_title`, `category_id`, `publish_time`, `trending_date`, `tags`, `description`, `thumbnail_link`.
    - **Engagement Metrics**: `views`, `likes`, `dislikes`, `comment_count`.
    - **Video Status Flags**: `comments_disabled`, `ratings_disabled`, `video_error_or_removed`.

2.  **`US_category_id.json`**: This JSON file provides a crucial mapping from the numerical `category_id` (found in `USvideos.csv`) to human-readable category names (e.g., 'Film & Animation', 'Music', 'Gaming'). This mapping is used to create a new `category` column in the main dataset, allowing for more intuitive analysis and strategy formulation based on actual content themes.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology & Analysis Pipeline

The project follows these key steps:

### 1. Data Loading & Initial Exploration

-   **Loaded YouTube video and category datasets** (`USvideos.csv`, `US_category_id.json`) using `pandas`.
    
-   **Conducted initial data assessment** to understand structure, identify missing values, and inform data cleaning and feature engineering.

### 2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

-   **Datetime Handling**: Converted `trending_date` and `publish_time` to datetime objects for temporal analysis.
    
-   **Feature Engineering**:
    
    -   Mapped `category_id` to category names using `US_category_id.json`.
        
    -   Extracted `trending_year`, `trending_month`, `trending_dayofweek`, and `publish_hour` to capture temporal patterns.
        
    -   Created `time_takes_to_trending` (days from publish to trending) and its binned version `time_cut`.
        
-   **Missing & Invalid Data Handling**:
    
    -   Filled missing `description` values with empty strings.
        
    -   Removed videos marked as errors or unavailable.
        
    -   Reassigned invalid `video_id` values (e.g., `#NAME?`) with consistent hashed IDs based on title and category to maintain trending history.


### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-   **Category Insights**: Analyzed video distribution, average likes, and views across content categories to identify high-performing segments.

### 4. Predicting Video Popularity

Focus on predicting video `views` based on `likes`, `dislikes`, and `comment_count` for individual videos.

- **Feature Selection**: `X` (feature): [`likes`,`dislikes`,`comment_count`], `y` (target): `views`.

- **Data Splitting**: Training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

- **Data Scaling**: Features/target scaled using `MinMaxScaler`.

- **Training**: Models explored: Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor

- **Evaluation Metrics**: MSE and R¬≤ Score.

### 5. Strategic Outlier Detection & Removal

To ensure robust model performance, it‚Äôs important to address outliers, particularly those caused by artificial engagement like purchased views. These anomalies often show unusually high views with disproportionately low likes or comments.


The main outlier handling strategy employs model-based filtering. A primary regression model (e.g., Random Forest) is trained to predict `views`. Subsequently, to detect if a new or existing video is an outlier, its features are fed into this model, and the normalized error of the prediction is calculated. Videos exhibiting a significantly high normalized error, indicating a substantial deviation from learned engagement patterns, are identified as outliers and can be removed or flagged for review.

#### ‚úÖ Conclusion

The model-based outlier detection process was highly effective‚Äî**1,958 anomalous data points** were removed. After cleaning, the Random Forest Regressor achieved an **R¬≤ score of 0.99**, indicating a near-perfect fit and highlighting the critical role of outlier removal for building a reliable prediction model.

### 7. Early-Stage Viewership Prediction with XGBoost

To provide advertisers with the earliest possible signal of a video's potential, a dedicated `XGBRegressor` model was developed. Its goal is to predict a video's final total views using only its initial trending performance metrics.


This forecasting tool provides a powerful strategic advantage, allowing advertisers to:

-   **Identify potential viral videos** before they peak.
-   **Secure ad placements at lower costs** before a video's popularity drives up ad rates.
-   **Maximize ROI** by locking in premium ad placements at a fraction of the future price.
